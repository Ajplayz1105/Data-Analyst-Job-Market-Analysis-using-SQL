High pay = hybrid roles, not pure analysts
Most skills listed (like Apache Kafka, Terraform) point to data engineering + DevOps, not basic analysis.
AI/ML skills significantly boost salary
Tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow show a shift toward predictive, AI-driven roles.
Top salaries often come from niche or rare skills
Some high-paying tools are legacy or specialized, meaning high pay is driven by scarcity, not widespread demand.
