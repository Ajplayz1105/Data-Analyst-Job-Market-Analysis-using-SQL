Cloud + big data tools dominate high pay (but lower demand): Skills like Snowflake, Azure, AWS, BigQuery, and Hadoop cluster around the top salaries (~109k–113k), yet their demand counts are relatively low—suggesting they’re niche but premium.
Core analytics stack = high demand, slightly lower pay: Python (236), Tableau (230), and R (148) have massive demand but sit closer to ~99k–101k—meaning they’re essential baseline skills, not differentiators.
Ecosystem skills are quietly valuable: Tools like Looker, Oracle, Jira, and SSIS show moderate demand with solid salaries, indicating that workflow, BI, and data infrastructure knowledge boosts overall market value beyond just coding.
